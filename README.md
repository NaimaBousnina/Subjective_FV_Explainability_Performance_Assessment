 ## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the source code and data of a software application used to validate the efficacy of a subjective explainability performance assessment protocol for visual explanations-based face verification explainability. The proposed protocol encompasses a set of key specifications designed to efficiently collect the subjectsâ€™ preferences and estimate explainability performance scores, facilitating the relative assessment of the explainability tools. This protocol aims to address the current gap in evaluating the effectiveness of visual explanation-based FV explain-ability tools, providing a structured approach for assessing their performance and comparing with alternative tools.
