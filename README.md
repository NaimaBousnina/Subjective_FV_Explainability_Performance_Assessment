  <h1 align="center"> Subjective Explainability Performance Assessment Protocol: Software Application </h1>
  This repository contains the source code and data of a software application used to validate the efficacy of a subjective explainability performance assessment protocol for visual explanations-based face verification explainability. The proposed protocol encompasses a set of key specifications designed to efficiently collect the subjectsâ€™ preferences and estimate explainability performance scores, facilitating the relative assessment of the explainability tools. This protocol aims to address the current gap in evaluating the effectiveness of visual explanation-based FV explain-ability tools, providing a structured approach for assessing their performance and comparing with alternative tools.

 ## 1. Introduction

 They key idea behind the RISE-based FV explainability method (FV-RISE) is to generate Similarity Heat Maps (S-HMs) and Dissimilarity Heat Maps (D-HMs) to explain the FV decisions according to the type of decision  performed, notably acceptance or rejection, for both genuine and impostor verification attempts. More precisely, S-HMs and D-HMs are used to explain the acceptance and rejection cases, respectively, regardless of true or false FV decisions being performed. The FV-RISE method is inspired by the random-masking approach used by [RISE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07421.pdf) to explain object classification, with the novelty that FV-RISE applies that approach to the FV task.
